Updated with an 8000 dpi Darkfield optical sensor, this versatile mouse is designed to provide precise tracking on almost any surface, including glass. At the same time, its Quiet Click buttons provide a satisfying feel while producing 90% less noise than the original MX Master, and the MagSpeed scroll wheel provides fast yet precise scrolling at up to 1000 lines per second. The ergonomic design fits most right hands and includes a convenient thumb rest area where you can quickly access buttons and a side scroll function. Pre-defined macOS shortcuts and app-specific profiles in the Logi Options+ software help to streamline your workflow.-",
